# Insulin Calculator App

## Project Description
 - This app is an insulin calculator developed with Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy.
 - The user has a landing page with foods available.
 - The user can add food items to a cart to select what to eat.
 - In the food cart, the user can enter their current sugar level and calculate how much insulin dosage is needed (insulin dosage is calculated based on a 1/10 * grams for food intake; and insulin dosage is calculated based on wether glucose is out of range)
